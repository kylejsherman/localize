# localize

There is a big movement to localize goods and services.
1. Food
2. Art
3. Clothing
4. Services

There is no reason we should not do this with software development. Let's credit companies for keeping their tech jobs local to their customers. Let's add transparency to consumers when companies outsource the tech talent overseas. Let's focus on supporting local tech talent that supports local communities instead of farming out tech development to the lowest bidder.
